					I moved to San Diego in 2008 to attend San Diego State University, where I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Economics. I played soccer for the Men's Club Team at SDSU, and in my last semester we won the NIRSA Open National Title. I continue to play and watch soccer as much as I can. Come on Arsenal! I currently live in Pacific Beach with friends from college.
					</p>

					<p>I am a beginner in the coding world, and was inspired by one of my high school friends. My goal with this course is to learn as much as I can, and pursue employment in the coding industry. I don't think I was this excited to learn when I was in Undergrad!
